Mozilla WebDev Pagination
moz_pagination is a very simple PHP library for helping with pagination.

It provides the MozPager php class.

This class is instanciated with $itemsPerPage, $totalItemCount and optionally $currentPage.
It then gives you an object with properties that
* tells you if there is a next page
* next page's number
* tells you if there is a previous page
* previous page's number
* offset to bind to a database query
* itemsPerPage for use as the LIMIT to bind to a database query

Optional
Also included is a PHP include template fragment that provides pagination navigation with
gettext strings. You can use it directly, or as an example if you want to do something different.
